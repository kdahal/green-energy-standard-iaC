Strategic Roadmap: Unifying Stem’s AI-Driven InfrastructureTarget Role: Senior DevOps Architect | Focus: PowerTrack, Athena, & Locus ConsolidationObjective: Transition from three siloed legacy platforms to a single, high-velocity "Golden Path" architecture to drive margin growth and operational excellence.Phase 1: Discovery, FinOps & Risk Mitigation (Days 1–30)Goal: Audit the "as-is" state and stop immediate cost/security leaks.Audit Technical Debt: Identify overlapping CI/CD tooling (Jenkins vs. GitHub Actions) and redundant observability licenses (Datadog vs. CloudWatch) across the three platforms.FinOps Baseline: Implement AWS Cost Categories to visualize exactly which AI models in Athena are driving the highest spend relative to PowerTrack revenue.Security Perimeter: Baseline all environments against NIST/SOC 2 standards (leveraging my background in high-compliance/Public Trust environments).Deliverable: The "Efficiency Gap" Report—prioritizing consolidation targets based on ROI.Phase 2: The "Golden Path" Architecture (Days 31–60)Goal: Build the foundational environment that empowers developers to self-serve.Unified Landing Zone: Deploy a multi-account strategy using AWS Control Tower to ensure inherited security guardrails for all teams.Standardized IaC Library: Develop "Stem-Standard" Terraform modules for EKS, RDS, and TimescaleDB, ensuring 100% architectural consistency.AIOps Integration: Set up centralized observability with ML-driven anomaly detection to identify telemetry lags in energy assets before they impact the customer.Deliverable: A "Self-Service Platform" ready for the first production pilot.Phase 3: Migration, Velocity & Scale (Days 61–90)Goal: Execute the merger and prove the value through a successful migration.The Pilot Migration: Move one critical non-production service from Locus or PowerTrack to the new unified platform to validate the "Golden Path."CI/CD Unification: Standardize on a single, secure deployment pipeline that automates compliance checks, reducing the burden on DevOps engineers.Developer Enablement: Establish "Office Hours" and Internal Developer Documentation to ensure the transition increases (not slows) engineering velocity.Deliverable: A successful pilot migration and a clear 12-month timeline for full technical debt retirement.Projected Business ImpactImpact AreaYear 1 Expected OutcomeOperational Costs15–20% Reduction in AWS spend through tooling consolidation and right-sizing.Security/Compliance100% Compliance with NIST/SOC 2 baselines for all new cloud resources.Engineering Velocity30% Faster time-to-market for new features via standardized "Golden Path" deployments.ReliabilityLower MTTR through unified tracing and predictive AIOps alerts.
